# The JUCE Library API documentation

This repository holds a copy of the doxygen-generated 
html files that document the JUCE library classes.

There's also a doxygen config file and shell script in here, which
you may want to use to generate the docs from the original juce source
files. This script isn't guaranteed to work on anyone's machine other
than my own, but you're welcome to play with it!
